# Object-Oriented Programming Assignment 🚀

## 📌 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️

### Task
- Create a **class** representing anything you like (e.g., Smartphone, Book, Superhero, etc.).
- Add **attributes** (variables) and **methods** (functions) to bring the class to life.
- Use a **constructor** (`__init__`) to initialize each object with unique values.
- Add an **inheritance layer** to demonstrate **polymorphism** or **encapsulation**.

### Example
```python


🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge!
Task

Create a program with multiple classes (e.g., Animals or Vehicles) that share the same method (like move()).

Each class should define move() differently.
