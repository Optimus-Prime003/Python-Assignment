# Iris Dataset Analysis Assignment

This project demonstrates loading, analyzing, and visualizing the **Iris dataset** using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

## 📂 Files Included

- **iris_analysis.py** – Python script version of the analysis.
- **requirements.txt** – List of Python dependencies required to run the notebook/script.
- **README.md** – Documentation of the assignment for Week 7.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the analysis as indicated below:
   - **Python Script**: Run the script directly from the terminal:  
     ```bash
     python iris_analysis.py
     ```

## 📊 Project Tasks

1. **Load and Explore the Dataset**
   - Loaded Iris dataset using `scikit-learn`.
   - Inspected first few rows, dataset info, and checked for missing values.

2. **Basic Data Analysis**
   - Computed summary statistics for numerical columns.
   - Grouped by species and calculated mean values.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Line Chart: Sepal length trend.
   - Bar Chart: Average petal length per species.
   - Histogram: Sepal width distribution.
   - Scatter Plot: Sepal length vs petal length.

## ✅ Findings & Observations

- **Setosa** generally has smaller sepal and petal sizes compared to **Versicolor** and **Virginica**.  
- Clear separation is visible between species when plotting sepal and petal features.  
- The dataset is clean with no missing values.  

## 📦 Dependencies

- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn
